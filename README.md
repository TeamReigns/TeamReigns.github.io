Doing this more or less as a project to keep me busy. I love to code i find it really fun but I hate feeling bored. Thats Ironic
because in the school year I die to be able to be home and just be lazy af during the summer. Course this was made 5 hours after developing
1/3 of the website. This was made for my new CSGO team I made for season 26. Course regrestration ends in like 16 days and I haven't
even done tryouts that leaves me with about 2 weeks for practice. Welp my team is prob gonna fail but I got faith. and its also really
fun to make a team and have people tryout and have them join because then I will have a section of my website dedicated to them. It gives 
me something to do. Coure the day of making this website is actually the day before I go back to school lmao. So I hope I don't feel 
extremely lazy within the first 2 days I will be happy. I hate feeling bored and but I also hate just wanting to go home and sleep so idk.
bored af rn though. Why am I writing this. no clue. It told me that if someone wanted to read about my project then this is wat they are 
gonna read. So yea thats why I made this. anyways yea I think Imma wrap this up and say I just made this to keep me busy.
